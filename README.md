# pre-commit-hooks

This repository is a collection of Git hooks to be used with the
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

Currently, the following hooks are supported:

## Terraform

- [terraform-fmt](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/fmt.html): The terraform fmt command is used to rewrite
  Terraform configuration `*.tf` files to a canonical format and style.
- [terraform-validate](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/validate.html): The terraform validate command validates
  all Terraform configuration `*.tf` files, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services
  such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.
- [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint): TFLint is a Terraform linter focused on possible errors, best
  practices, etc. (Terraform >= 0.12). Applied to all Terraform configuration `*.tf` files.

## Go

- [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/): Go fmt is a tool that automatically formats Go `*.go` files to canonical
  format and style.
- [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports): The goimports command updates import lines in Go
  `*.go` files, adding missing ones and removing unreferenced ones.
- [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint): Golint is a linter that formats your Go `*.go` files.
- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint): GolangCI-Lint is a linters aggregator.
  It's fast: on average 5 times faster than gometalinter. It's easy to integrate and use, has nice output and has a
  minimum number of false positives.

## GNU Make

- [phony-targets](https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks/blob/master/pre_commit_hooks/make/phony-targets.sh):
  This hook validates if targets that are marked as `PHONY` actually exist.

## Markdown

- [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check): Checks that all of the hyperlinks in a markdown
  text to determine if they are alive or dead.

## Bash
- [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck): ShellCheck is a GPLv3 tool that gives warnings and suggestions
  for bash/sh shell scripts.


## Installation & Dependencies

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). E.g. `brew install pre-commit`
1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint),
  [Go](https://golang.org/), [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check). E.g

    ``` shell script
      brew install terraform \
          tflint \
          go \
          golangci/tap/golangci-lint \
          shellcheck && \
          npm install -g markdown-link-check
    ```

## Usage

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside your repositories and add the desired list of hooks.
Please see the [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) for further information.

``` yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: <VERSION> # Check for the latest version: https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks/releases
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
      - id: terraform-validate
      - id: tflint
      - id: gofmt
      - id: goimports
      - id: golint
      - id: golangci-lint
      - id: phony-targets
      - id: markdown-link-check
```

Once you created the configuration file inside your repository, you must run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks.
That's it, pre-commit will now listen for changes in your files and run the checks accordingly.

### Run

It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only
run on the changed files during git hooks).

#### Example: Run All Hooks

``` shell script
pre-commit run --all-files
``` 

#### Example: Run A Specific Hook

``` shell script
pre-commit run terraform-validate --all-files
```

### Pre-Commit and Continuous Integration

It's recommended to run pre-commit as part of CI pipeline/build as there will be always that one rebel in the team
who won't run them locally. On CI, replace `pre-commit install` by `pre-commit run -a`. We don't need to install it on
CI as it'll be a one-shot operation. run -a will run the hooks over all files (taking into account excludes if
configured).

### Add Custom Hooks

All `*.sh` files inside pre_commit_hooks need to be flagged as executable. Otherwise the pre-commit hooks won't be
executable by default. You apply the flag to all `*.sh` files with the following command:

``` bash
find pre_commit_hooks/ -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
```
