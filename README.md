# pre-commit-hooks

This repository is a collection of Git hooks to be used with the
[pre-commit]([pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/)) framework.

Currently, the following hooks are supported:

**Terraform**
- terraform-fmt: The terraform fmt command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration `*.tf` files to a canonical format and style.
- terraform-validate: The terraform validate command validates all Terraform configuration `*.tf` files, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.
- tflint: TFLint is a Terraform linter focused on possible errors, best practices, etc. (Terraform >= 0.12). Applied to all Terraform configuration `*.tf` files.

**Go**
- gofmt: go fmt is a tool that automatically formats `*.go` files to canonical format and style..
- goimports: The goimports command updates import lines in `*.go` files, adding missing ones and removing unreferenced ones.        
- golint: Golint is a linter that formats your `*.go` files.

## Installation & Dependencies
Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). E.G. `brew install pre-commit`



## Usage
Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside your repositories and add the desired list of hooks.
Please see the [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) for further information.

``` yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: <VERSION> # Check for the latest version: https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks/releases
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
      - id: terraform-validate
      - id: tflint
      - id: gofmt
      - id: goimports
      - id: golint
```

Once you created the configuration file inside your repository, you must run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks.
That's it, pre-commit will now listen for changes in your files and run the checks accordingly.

### Run

It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only
run on the changed files during git hooks).

#### Example: Run All Hooks
``` shell script
pre-commit run --all-files
``` 

#### Example: Run A Specific Hook
``` shell script
pre-commit run terraform-validate --all-files
```

### Pre-Commit and Continuous Integration
Might be also worth to run pre-commit as part of CI pipeline/build as there will be always that one rebel in the team
who won't run them locally. On CI, replace `pre-commit install` by `pre-commit run -a`. We don't need to install it on
CI as it'll be a one-shot operation. run -a will run the hooks over all files (taking into account excludes if
configured).

### Add Custom Hooks

All `*.sh` files inside pre_commit_hooks need to be flagged as executable. Otherwise the pre-commit hooks won't be
executable by default. You apply the flag to all `*.sh` files with the following command:

``` bash
find pre_commit_hooks/ -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
```
